# Simple static page

Made for a [dev.to challenge](https://dev.to/challenges/frontend-2024-05-29)

I have used CSS and JavaScript to make the starter HTML markup beautiful, interactive, and useful.
The template does not include photos, so to make it visually appealing, a simple JavaScript is used.
All images were generated with Adobe Firefly AI generator.

## Start

No npm, no node_modules. Just plain JavaScript.
Run a static server like `python -m http.server`, or `caddy`, or VSCode liveserver
